A not-for-profit pet rescue organisation has come to you for help. They want to create a website
they can use to show a list of pets available for adoption. The pets available for adoption will change
often, and their details may need updating â€“ therefore, they want a system in which they can easily
upload animal details without having to do any coding. Animal detail entry and editing should be
limited to only authorised persons. Anyone should be able to view a list of pets available for
adoption
